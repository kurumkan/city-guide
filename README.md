#FreeCodeCamp Challenge: Build a Nightlife Coordination App

A NodeJS App that uses the Yelp API. The app allows for users to search for bars in their area and they can indicate if they are going to there.

See <a href="https://city-guide-app.herokuapp.com/">the demo</a>

### User stories:
* As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
* As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
* As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
* As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
